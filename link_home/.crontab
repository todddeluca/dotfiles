# brief primer on cron job format.  for more, see http://www.unixgeeks.org/security/newbie/unix/cron-1.html or google cron tutorial
# minofhour 24hourofday dayofmonth monthofyear dayofweek(0=sunday,6=saturday) commandline

# Minute = Minute of the hour, 00 to 59. * Will indicate every minute (details later)
# Hour = Hour of the day in 24-hour format, 00 to 23. * Will indicate every hour (details later)
# Day = Day of the month, 1 to 31. * Will indicate every day (details later)
# Month = Month of the year, 1 to 12. * Will indicate every month (details later)
# Day = Day of the week, 3 chars - sun, mon, tue, or numeric (0=sun, 1=mon etc).... * Will indicate every day (details later)
# Task = The command you want to execute 

# to run a command every 5 minutes:
# 0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * /path/to/command
# or
# */5 * * * * /path/to/command


# to specify where to mail the job output, put this (uncommmented) before the command
# MAILTO=cron@username.plus.com

# absolute paths: cron does not have $PATH defined the way you have it defined when you are logged in, so use absolute paths in commands
# alternatively, run your .bashrc (or equivalent) script before the command
# * * * * * . /home/tfd/.bash_profile && printenv

# to set up use of lsf, python (from the environment), etc., replace <command> with:
# . /home/tfd/.bash_profile && <command>
# since cron runs jobs as the user but without logging in, this is necessary to run a bsub command or python2.4,
# both of which are set up in my bash profile.

# if changing a command which redirects output, e.g. foo > bar, to run on lsf,
# put command in quotes or else redirection will redirect bsub output, not command output:
# . /home/tfd/.bash_profile && bsub 'foo > bar'

# example commands
# 17 11 * * * echo $PATH
